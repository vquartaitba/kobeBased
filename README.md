## Description

Kobe is an advanced tool designed to facilitate development on the Base blockchain, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). This assistant provides an intuitive interface for developers to interact with intelligent models, efficiently generate and deploy smart contracts, and get the latest updates from the blockchain space.

With Kobe, anyone can automate the creation and development of a smart contract, from generation to deployment on Base, all within one environment.

## Features

### Smart Contract Generation: Automatically generates contracts for Base using artificial intelligence.
### Testing and Validation: Validates and tests the generated smart contracts before deployment.
### Compilation and Deployment: Compiles and deploys contracts directly onto the Base blockchain from the tool.
### Real-Time Information: Access the latest blockchain updates through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies, ensuring you're always up-to-date.
